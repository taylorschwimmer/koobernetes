    This program is expensive software: you can modify it but I won't be happy
    about it. You don't you have anything better to do? If you really want to use this
    then you should mail me a check for at least 6 figures, that's the smallest
    I'll get out of bed for. 

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; it's likely to cause your computer to crash or
    otherwise be irreparably damaged. Use at your own risk.
